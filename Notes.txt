Connect the GraphQL client to the API Gateway GraphQL endpoint. In this case, the GraphQL endpoint is http://localhost:3000/graphql.
Write and send GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions to interact with the API:
1-Sending a GraphQL query to retrieve all users:
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
2: Sending a GraphQL mutation to create a user:
mutation {
  createUser(id: "123", name: "John Doe", email: "johndoe@example.com", password: "password") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
 3: Sending a GraphQL query to retrieve a specific user by ID:
 query {
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
4: Sending a GraphQL query to retrieve all products:
query {
  products {
    id
    title
    description
    price
  }
}
5: Sending a GraphQL query to retrieve a specific product by ID:
query {
  product(id: "456") {
    id
    title
    description
    price
  }
}
